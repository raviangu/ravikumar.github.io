# Simple Static Site

A clean, responsive static website—no build tools. Edit text in `index.html`, colors in `styles.css`, and assets in `/assets`.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
2. Replace `hello@example.com` in **Contact** with your email.
3. Swap images in `/assets`.

## One‑click Hosting Options

### GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `your-username.github.io`.
2. Upload all files from this folder (or push via Git).
3. Visit `https://your-username.github.io` after a minute.

### Netlify (free, fastest)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag‑and‑drop this folder—done.

### Vercel (free)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import the repo or drag the folder.

### Cloudflare Pages (free, super fast)

2. Create a project and connect your repo/folder.

## Custom Domain
Point your domain’s DNS to your chosen host (A/ALIAS/CNAME records). Most hosts have wizards for this.

## Contact Form
The form uses a placeholder action URL. Replace it with Formspree, Vercel Forms, Netlify Forms, etc. Or remove the `<form>` and use the mailto button instead.
